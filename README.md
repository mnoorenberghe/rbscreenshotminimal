Review Board Minimal Screenshot Review UI
==============

Review Board extension to make image attachment reviews very simple and hide
other knobs which aren't important.

This extension auto-publishes image reviews so the draft banner doesn't appear
and it doesn't redirect users back to the review after doing so.

Buttons to change the status of issues are also hidden.

This extension was written to crowd-source image attachment reviews without
exposing users to the other features of Review Board.
